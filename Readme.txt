At the Home Page, you can access 4 pages: Access your pantry, View and update dietary profiles, and Plan a meal, Our recipe Community.

To access Pantry click the first widget.
 There you will see the ingredients of your pantry.
 To remove items click the X button.
 To add items click on Add button which will take you to a new activity.
 There you will see a list of ingredients where you can enter an amount and add it.

Click on the second widget to see all your potential guests.
 To add a new guest profile click on the add button which will take you to a new activity where you can enter your guest's information. Enter their first name in the box labelled "Enter a first name", their last name in the box labelled "Enter a last name", and click any necessary dietary restrictions. If a restriction is green, that means the restriction has been successfully added to the profile. If you'd like to remove a restriction, just press any restriction that's currently green. If a restriction is grey, that means that it's not a listed dietary restriction for that guest. Press the pink check button in the bottom right to save the profile. If you get a popup that says the profiles has been successfully saved, you can safely press the back arrow button in the bottom left to return to the list of all profiles. You'll be able to see new profiles there as soon as you've successfully added them! When you click a profile, you'll be able to see their name and a list of the dietary restrictions that they have.
 
To check what Recipes are available, go to home by clicking the home icon on the bottom left.
 Then click on the third widget that says Plan a meal.
 There you will see the list of recipes you can make from your ingredients.
